    marble_dia = 1.6; // The Diameter of your Marbles

    //Marble Barrel Setup

    marblebarrel_slot_radius = 5.75; // Radius to center of slots
    marblebarrel_slot_n = 10;  // Amount of Slots in Barrel

    // Spokes Setup
    spokes_use = true;
    spokes_radius_outer = 4.5;

### Marble Pump
Marbles are taken from one hole and pushed out of another. Building a Vertical tube around the second hole will generate a vertical lift for the marbles. 

### Piston Steps
There are several continously larger block-pistons placed on one a camshaft. Each Endposition will enable two steps to be on the Same level, so the marble may roll to the next piston ...
